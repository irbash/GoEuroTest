Java Developer - Test
The purpose of this test is to see how you approach a problem and what your solutions look like. The
requirements for this test are simple and should be straightforward to grasp. When implementing a
solution, please keep things simple as well. That said:
Implement an API query and transform this data into a
csv file
Create a Java command line tool that takes as an input parameter a string
java -jar GoEuroTest.jar "STRING"
The program takes this string and queries with it our Location JSON API:
The app should use this API endpoint:
GET http://pre.dev.goeuro.de:12345/api/v1/suggest/position/en/name/STRING
Where STRING is the string that the user has entered as a parameter when calling the tool.
The API endpoint returns JSON documents like these:
{
"results" : [ {
"_type" : "Position",
"_id" : 410978,
"name" : "Potsdam, USA",
"type" : "location",
"geo_position" : {
"latitude" : 44.66978,
"longitude" : -74.98131
}
}, {
"_type" : "Position",
"_id" : 377078,
"name" : "Potsdam, Deutschland",
"type" : "location",
"geo_position" : {
"latitude" : 52.39886,
"longitude" : 13.06566
}
} ]
}
The endpoint always responds with a JSON object that has a results key. The value for that key is either
null or an array of objects. Each object, among other keys, has a name and a geo_positition key. The
geo_position key is an object with latitude and longitude fields.
The program should query the API with the user input and create a CSV file from it. The CSV file should
have the form: _type, _id, name, type, latitude, longitude
Your solution
Please implement your solution as a stand alone application which can be started from the command line,
i.e. send us a fat jar file with all dependecies. You can use Java 7 and open source libraries that you think
help you to fulfill this task.
Also send us the source code to your solution. We use GitHub, so if you put your source code into a
GitHub repository, it will make our life easier.
We will evaluate your source code as well as the functionality of the program: Does it run, how does it
handle errors, etc.
Thank you!
